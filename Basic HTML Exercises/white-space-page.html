<body>
    <h1>Understanding White Space</h1>

    <p>Line breaks skips to the next line of text. <br> Like this.</p>
    <p>For paragraphs, browsers add empty lines before and after them. For instance, this is one paragraph.</p>
    <p>And this is another, with no line breaks in between.</p>
    <p>
        Finally, multiple spaces do not get rendered as expected. See the example
        below with 10 spaces between each number: <br> 1          2          3          4          5
    </p>
