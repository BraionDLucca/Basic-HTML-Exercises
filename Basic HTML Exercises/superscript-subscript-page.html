        The chemical equation representing the formation of water from its constituent elements, hydrogen and oxygen, is given by: 
        <b>2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> = 2H<sub>2</sub>O</b>
        <br>
        This equation indicates that two molecules of diatomic hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) react with one molecule of diatomic oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) to produce two molecules of water (H<sub>2</sub>O). The coefficients in front of each chemical formula ensure that the number of atoms of each element is balanced on both sides of the equation, adhering to the law of conservation of mass.Â
